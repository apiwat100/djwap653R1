    <p class="text-center text-primary"> Georgia, wrap me up in all your-<br>
    I want you in my arms<br>
    Oh, let me hold you<br>
    I'll never let you go again like I did<br>
    Oh, I used to say<br>
    "I would never fall in love again until I found her"<br>
    I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"<br>
    I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her<br>
    I found you<br>
    Heaven, when I held you again<br>
    How could we ever just be friends?<br>
    I would rather die than let you go<br>
    Juliet to your Romeo, how I heard you say<br>
    "I would never fall in love again until I found her"<br>
    I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"<br>
    I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her<br>
    I found you<br>
    I would never fall in love again until I found her<br>
    I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"<br>
    I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her<br>
    I found you</p>
